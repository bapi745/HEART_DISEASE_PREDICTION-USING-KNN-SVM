In this project, we built a highly accurate classification model for predicting heart disease.

**Key Steps Undertaken:**
1.  **Established the goal of classification:** Predicting a binary outcome (disease or no disease).
2.  **Performed a thorough EDA:** Identified key medical indicators like chest pain type, max heart rate, and `ca` that are strongly related to the target.
3.  **Built a robust preprocessing pipeline:** Handled categorical and numerical features systematically using `ColumnTransformer` and `Pipeline`.
4.  **Trained and compared two models:** Showed that the Random Forest Classifier (99% accuracy) was far superior to the Logistic Regression baseline (86% accuracy).
5.  **Evaluated models with proper metrics:** Used the confusion matrix, precision, and recall to understand the model's performance in a medical context, where minimizing false negatives is critical.
6.  **Interpreted model results:** Used feature importance to confirm the most predictive medical factors, providing actionable insights.

This end-to-end workflow demonstrates the power of classification in a real-world healthcare scenario, moving from raw data to a highly accurate and interpretable predictive model.
